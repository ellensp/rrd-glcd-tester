# rrd-glcd-tester

A simple sketch to test all fuctions of a RepRapDiscount Full Graphic Smart Controller or compatable.

This also demonstrates how to use this GLCD outside of a reprap/3d printer firmware

Designed for a ramps 1.4 board on a mega2560

It's all rather self explanatory

Flash this to the board and verify you get a display.
The Title moves to show you its doing something.
Try all the buttons and knobs, verify the display says they are working.
If you insert the SD card it will try to read it and display the results. Remove the SD card to return to the main testing screen.
Hold down both the STOP and Encoder button to activate the buzzer.
